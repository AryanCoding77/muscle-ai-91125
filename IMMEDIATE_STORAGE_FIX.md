# 🚨 IMMEDIATE STORAGE FIX REQUIRED

## Current Issue
The image upload is failing because the **`analyze-images` bucket doesn't exist** in your Supabase project.

**Verification Result:**
```
📦 Available buckets: []
❌ analyze-images bucket NOT found
```

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **Storage** in the left sidebar  
3. Click **"New Bucket"**
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `analyze-images`
   - **Public**: ✅ **YES** 
   - **File size limit**: `10MB`
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp`

### Step 2: Apply Storage Policies
Run this SQL in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Policy: Users can upload their own analyze images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own analyze images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'analyze-images' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Policy: Users can view their own analyze images
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own analyze images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'analyze-images' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Policy: Users can delete their own analyze images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own analyze images" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'analyze-images' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Restart your Expo app
2. Take a new analyze photo
3. Check logs - should see: `✅ Upload successful: analyze-images/[user-id]/[filename]`
4. Check Supabase Storage - should see the uploaded image

## 🔍 Verification
Run this to verify setup:
```bash
node verify-storage.js
```

Should show:
```
✅ analyze-images bucket exists
```

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Before (Current - Broken):
```
📤 Starting image upload to Supabase storage...
ERROR Creating blobs from 'ArrayBuffer' and 'ArrayBufferView' are not supported
❌ Failed to upload image, using local URI as fallback
```

### After (Fixed):
```
📤 Starting image upload to Supabase storage...
✅ Upload successful: analyze-images/f9c54b2e-b757-4992-ba65-838204283276/1759686337785_98tc9pb4qbl.png
🌐 Public URL: https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/analyze-images/...
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

1. **Images will be stored permanently** in Supabase cloud storage
2. **URLs will be cloud URLs** instead of local file paths
3. **Images will persist** and show correctly in Progress tab
4. **No more "empty URI" warnings**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Existing analyses** will still have local URIs (those are lost)
- **New analyses** after this fix will have permanent cloud storage
- **The bucket MUST be public** for images to display in the app
- **Storage policies are required** for security

This is the root cause of your image storage issue - the bucket simply doesn't exist yet!
